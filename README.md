# Self-Calibration package

###### G4Sim ######
generate AGATA Compton scattering data with pulse shape



###### SelfCalibPulse ######
perform Self-Calibration on the simulation data

method 1: group pulse shape with Chi2 similarity. Pulse Shape Collection (PSC) grow up from single pulse.

method 2: put pulse shape in big PSC, then divide PSC according to deviation from averaged pulse
